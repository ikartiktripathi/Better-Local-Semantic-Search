Using ngrams to suggest next possible words given previous words typed by the user. Implemented a Trie for suggesting these words which stores ngrams.

Trying to comeup with a data structure to store this data in files such that searching in files for the relevant ngrams to suggest the user is faster.

compile :
		g++ -o main main.cpp trie.cpp
run :
